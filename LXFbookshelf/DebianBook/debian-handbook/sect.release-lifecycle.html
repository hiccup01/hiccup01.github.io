			The project will simultaneously have three or four different versions of each program, named <span class="distribution distribution">Experimental</span>, <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span>, <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>, and <span class="distribution distribution">Stable</span>. Each one corresponds to a different phase in development. For a good understanding, let us take a look at a program's journey, from its initial packaging to inclusion in a stable version of Debian.
		</div><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>VOCABULARY</em></span> Release</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3115872" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
			The term “release”, in the Debian project, indicates a particular version of a distribution (e.g., “unstable release” means “the unstable version”). It also indicates the public announcement of the launch of any new version (stable).
		</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp3116920">1.5.1. The <span class="distribution distribution">Experimental</span> Status</h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				First let us take a look at the particular case of the <span class="distribution distribution">Experimental</span> distribution: this is a group of Debian packages corresponding to the software currently in development, and not necessarily completed, explaining its name. Not everything passes through this step; some developers add packages here in order to get feedback from more experienced (or braver) users.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Otherwise, this distribution frequently houses important modifications to base packages, whose integration into <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> with serious bugs would have critical repercussions. It is, thus, a completely isolated distribution, its packages never migrate to another version (except by direct, express intervention of the maintainer or the ftpmasters).
			</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp3119664">1.5.2. The <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> Status</h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Let us turn back to the case of a typical package. The maintainer creates an initial package, which they compile for the <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> version and place on the <code class="literal">ftp-master.debian.org</code> server. This first event involves inspection and validation from the ftpmasters. The software is then available in the <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> distribution, which is risky, but chosen by users who are more concerned with staying close to the cutting edge, with more up to date packages, than they are worried about serious bugs. They discover the program and then test it.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				If they encounter bugs, they report them to the package's maintainer. The maintainer then regularly prepares corrected versions, which they upload to the server.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Every newly updated package is updated on all Debian mirrors around the world within less than six hours. The users then test the corrections and search for other problems resulting from the modifications. Several updates may then occur rapidly. During these times, autobuilder robots come into action. Most frequently, the maintainer has only one traditional PC and has compiled his package on i386 architecture (or amd64); the autobuilders take over and automatically compile versions for all the other architectures. Some compilations may fail; the maintainer will then receive a bug report indicating the problem, which is then to be corrected in the next versions. When the bug is discovered by a specialist for the architecture in question, the bug report may come with a patch ready to use.
			</div><a id="idp3123536" class="indexterm"></a><div class="figure"><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/autobuilder.png" alt="Compilation of a package by the autobuilders" /></div></div><h6>Figure 1.2. Compilation of a package by the autobuilders</h6></div><br class="figure-break" /><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>QUICK LOOK</em></span> <code class="command">buildd</code>, the Debian package recompiler</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3126592" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3127152" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>buildd</em></span> is the abbreviation of “build daemon”. This program automatically recompiles new versions of Debian packages on the architectures on which it is hosted (cross-compiling not always being sufficient) .
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Thus, to produce binaries for the <code class="literal">sparc</code> architecture, the project has <code class="literal">sparc</code> machines available (specifically, Sun brand). The program <span class="emphasis"><em>buildd</em></span> runs on them continuously to create package binaries for <code class="literal">sparc</code> from source packages sent by Debian developers.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This software is used on all the computers serving autobuilders for Debian. By extension, the term <span class="emphasis"><em>buildd</em></span> frequently is used to refer to these machines, which are generally reserved solely for this purpose.
			</div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp3130528">1.5.3. Migration to <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span></h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				A bit later, the package will have matured; compiled on all the architectures, it will not have undergone recent modifications. It is then a candidate for inclusion in the <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> distribution — a group of <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> packages chosen according to some quantifiable criteria. Every day a program automatically selects the packages to include in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>, according to elements guaranteeing a certain level of quality:
			</div><div class="orderedlist"><ol><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						lack of critical bugs, or, at least fewer than the version currently included in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>;
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						at least 10 days spent in <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span>, which is sufficient time to find and report any serious problems;
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						successful compilation on all officially supported architectures;
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						dependencies that can be satisfied in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>, or that can at least be moved there together with the package in question.
					</div></li></ol></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				This system is clearly not infallible; critical bugs are regularly found in packages included in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>. Still, it is generally effective, and <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> poses far fewer problems than <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span>, being for many, a good compromise between stability and novelty.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE</em></span> Limitations of <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span></h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Very interesting in principle, <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> poses some practical problems: the tangle of cross-dependencies between packages is such that a package can never move there completely on its own. With packages all depending upon each other, it is necessary to move a large number simultaneously, which is impossible when some are uploading updates regularly. On the other hand, the script identifying the families of related packages works hard to create them (this would be an NP-complete problem, for which, fortunately, we know some good heuristics). This is why we can manually interact with and guide this script by suggesting groups of packages, or imposing the inclusion of certain packages in a group, even if this temporarily breaks some dependencies. This functionality is accessible to the Release Managers and their assistants.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Recall that an NP-complete problem is of an exponential algorithmic complexity according to the size of the data, here being the length of the code (the number of figures) and the elements involved. The only way to resolve it is frequently to examine all possible configurations, which could require enormous means. A heuristic is an approximate, but satisfying, solution.
			</div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>COMMUNITY</em></span> The Release Manager</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3141696" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3142160" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				Release Manager is an important title, associated with heavy responsibilities. The bearer of this title must, in effect, manage the release of a new, stable version of Debian, and define the process for development of <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> until it meets the quality criteria for <span class="distribution distribution">Stable</span>. They also define a tentative schedule (not always followed).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				We also have Stable Release Managers, often abbreviated SRM, who manage and select updates for the current stable version of Debian. They systematically include security patches and examine all other proposals for inclusion, on a case by case basis, sent by Debian developers eager to update their package in the stable version.
			</div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="idp3144648">1.5.4. The Promotion from <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> to <span class="distribution distribution">Stable</span></h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Let us suppose that our package is now included in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span>. While it has room for improvement, the manager thereof must continue to improve it and restart the process from <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> (but its later inclusion in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> is generally faster: If it has not changed significantly, all of its dependencies are already available). When it reaches perfection, the maintainer has completed their work. The next step is the inclusion in the <span class="distribution distribution">Stable</span> distribution, which is, in reality, a simple copy of <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> at a moment chosen by the Release Manager. Ideally this decision is made when the installer is ready, and when no program in <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> has any known critical bugs.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Since this moment never truly arrives, in practice, Debian must compromise: remove packages whose maintainer has failed to correct bugs on time, or agree to release a distribution with some bugs in the thousands of programs. The Release Manager will have previously announced a freeze period, during which each update to <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> must be approved. The goal here is to prevent any new version (and its new bugs), and to only approve updates fixing bugs.
			</div><div class="figure"><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/cycle-release.png" alt="A package's path through the various Debian versions" /></div></div><h6>Figure 1.3. A package's path through the various Debian versions</h6></div><br class="figure-break" /><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>VOCABULARY</em></span> Freeze: the home straight</h6></div></div></div><a id="idp3152136" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp3152616" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
				During the freeze period, development of the <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> distribution is blocked; no more automatic updates are allowed. Only the Release Managers are then authorized to change packages, according to their own criteria. The purpose is to prevent the appearance of new bugs by introducing new versions; only thoroughly examined updates are authorized when they correct significant bugs.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				After the release of a new stable version, the Stable Release Manager manages all further development (called “revisions”, ex: 5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3 for version 5.0). These updates systematically include all security patches. They will also include the most important corrections (the maintainer of a package must prove the gravity of the problem that they wish to correct in order to have their updates included).
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				End of the journey: Our hypothetical package is now included in the stable distribution. This journey, not without its difficulties, explains the significant delays separating the Debian Stable releases. This contributes, over all, to its reputation for quality. Furthermore, the majority of users are satisfied using one of the three distributions simultaneously available. The system administrators, concerned above all, for the stability of their servers, mock the latest version of GNOME; They can choose Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Stable</span>, and they will be satisfied. End users, more interested in the latest versions of GNOME or KDE than in rock-solid stability, will find Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Testing</span> to be a good compromise between a lack of serious problems and relatively up to date software. Finally, developers and more experienced users may blaze the trail, testing all the latest developments in Debian <span class="distribution distribution">Unstable</span> right out of the gate, at the risk of suffering the headaches and bugs inherent in any new version of a program. To each their own Debian!

				GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) and KDE (K Desktop Environment) are the two most popular graphical desktop environments in the free software world. A desktop environment is a set of programs grouped together to allow easy management of the most common operations through a graphical interface. They generally include a file manager, office suite, web browser, e-mail program, multimedia accessories, etc. The most visible difference resides in the choice of the graphical library used: GNOME has chosen GTK+ (free software licensed under the LGPL), and KDE has selected Qt (from the company, Trolltech, who released it under the GPL license). <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a></div> <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</a></div>
