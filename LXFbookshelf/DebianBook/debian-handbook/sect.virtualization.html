			Virtualization 
			<a id="idp10857912" class="indexterm"></a>
			 is one of the most major advances in the recent years of computing. The term covers various abstractions and techniques simulating virtual computers with a variable degree of independence on the actual hardware. One physical server can then host several systems working at the same time and in isolation. Applications are many, and often derive from this isolation: test environments with varying configurations for instance, or separation of hosted services across different virtual machines for security.
		</div><div class="para"><p></p>
			There are multiple virtualization solutions, each with its own pros and cons. This book will focus on Xen, LXC, and KVM, but other noteworthy implementations include the following:

					QEMU is a software emulator for a full computer; performances are far from the speed one could achieve running natively, but this allows running unmodified or experimental operating systems on the emulated hardware.

				Xen 
				<a id="idp10868184" class="indexterm"></a>
				 is a “paravirtualization” solution. It introduces a thin abstraction layer, called a “hypervisor”, between the hardware and the upper systems; this acts as a referee that controls access to hardware from the virtual machines. However, it only handles a few of the instructions, the rest is directly executed by the hardware on behalf of the systems. The main advantage is that performances are not degraded, and systems run close to native speed; the drawback is that the kernels of the operating systems one wishes to use on a Xen hypervisor need to be adapted to run on Xen.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Let's spend some time on terms. The hypervisor is the lowest layer, that runs directly on the hardware, even below the kernel. This hypervisor can split the rest of the software across several <span class="emphasis"><em>domains</em></span>, which can be seen as so many virtual machines. One of these domains (the first one that gets started) is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>dom0</em></span>, and has a special role, since only this domain can control the hypervisor and the execution of other domains. These other domains are known as <span class="emphasis"><em>domU</em></span>. In other words, and from a user point of view, the <span class="emphasis"><em>dom0</em></span> matches the “host” of other virtualizaton systems, while a <span class="emphasis"><em>domU</em></span> can be seen as a “guest”.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> Xen and the various versions of Linux</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Xen was initially developed as a set of patches that lived out of the official tree, and not integrated to the Linux kernel. At the same time, several upcoming virtualization systems (including KVM) required some generic virtualization-related functions to facilitate their integration, and the Linux kernel gained this set of functions (known as the <span class="emphasis"><em>paravirt_ops</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>pv_ops</em></span> interface). Since the Xen patches were duplicating some of the functionality of this interface, they couldn't be accepted officially.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Xensource, the company behind Xen, therefore had to port Xen to this new framework, so that the Xen patches could be merged into the official Linux kernel. That meant a lot of code rewrite, and although Xensource soon had a working version based on the paravirt_ops interface, the patches were only progressively merged into the official kernel. The merge was completed in Linux 3.0. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenParavirtOps">http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenParavirtOps</a></div>
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Although <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> is based on version 2.6.32 of the Linux kernel, a version including the Xen patches from Xensource is also available in the <span class="pkg pkg">linux-image-2.6-xen-686</span> and <span class="pkg pkg">linux-image-2.6-xen-amd64</span> packages. This distribution-specific patching means that the available featureset depends on the distibution; discrepancies in the versions of the code, or even integration of code still under development into some distributions also mean differences in the supported features. This problem should be greatly reduced now that Xen has been officially merged into Linux. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://wiki.xen.org/xenwiki/XenKernelFeatures">http://wiki.xen.org/xenwiki/XenKernelFeatures</a></div>

				Using Xen under Debian requires three components:
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE</em></span> Architectures compatible with Xen</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Xen is currently only available for the i386 and amd64 architectures. Moreover, it uses processor instructions that haven't always been provided in all i386-class computers. Note that most of the Pentium-class (or better) processors made after 2001 will work, so this restriction won't apply to very many situations.
			</div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>CULTURE</em></span> Xen and non-Linux kernels</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Xen requires modifications to all the operating systems one wants to run on it; not all kernels have the same level of maturity in this regard. Many are fully-functional, both as dom0 and domU: Linux 2.6 (as patched by Debian) and 3.0, NetBSD 4.0 and later, and OpenSolaris. Others, such as OpenBSD 4.0, FreeBSD 8 and Plan 9, only work as a domU.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				However, if Xen can rely on the hardware functions dedicated to virtualization (which are only present in more recent processors), even non-modified operating systems can run as domU (including Windows).
			</div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						The hypervisor itself. According to the available hardware, the appropriate package will be either <span class="pkg pkg">xen-hypervisor-4.0-i386</span> or <span class="pkg pkg">xen-hypervisor-4.0-amd64</span>.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						A kernel with the appropriate patches allowing it to work on that hypervisor. In the 2.6.32 case relevant to <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span>, the available hardware will dictate the choice among the various available <span class="pkg pkg">xen-linux-system-2.6.32-5-xen-*</span> packages.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						The i386 architecture also requires a standard library with the appropriate patches taking advantage of Xen; this is in the <span class="pkg pkg">libc6-xen</span> package.
					</div></li></ul></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				In order to avoid the hassle of selecting these components by hand, a few convenience packages (such as <span class="pkg pkg">xen-linux-system-2.6.32-5-xen-686</span> and variants) have been made available; they all pull in a known-good combination of the appropriate hypervisor and kernel packages. The hypervisor also brings <span class="pkg pkg">xen-utils-4.0</span>, which contains tools to control the hypervisor from the dom0. This in turn brings the appropriate standard library. During the installation of all that, configuration scripts also create a new entry in the Grub bootloader menu, so as to start the chosen kernel in a Xen dom0. Note however that this entry is not usually set to be the first one in the list, and will therefore not be selected by default. If that is not the desired behavior, the following commands will change it:
			</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>mv /etc/grub.d/20_linux_xen /etc/grub.d/09_linux_xen
</code></strong><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>update-grub
</code></strong></pre><div class="para"><p></p>
				Once these prerequisites are installed, the next step is to test the behaviour of the dom0 by itself; this involves a reboot to the hypervisor and the Xen kernel. The system should boot in its standard fashion, with a few extra messages on the console during the early initialization steps.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Now is the time to actually install useful systems on the domU systems, using the tools from <span class="pkg pkg">xen-tools</span>. This package provides the <code class="command">xen-create-image</code> command, which largely automates the task. The only mandatory parameter is <code class="literal">--hostname</code>, giving a name to the domU; other options are important, but they can be stored in the <code class="filename">/etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf</code> configuration file, and their absence from the command line doesn't trigger an error. It is therefore important to either check the contents of this file before creating images, or to use extra parameters in the <code class="command">xen-create-image</code> invocation. Important parameters of note include the following:
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						<code class="literal">--memory</code>, to specify the amount of RAM dedicated to the newly created system;
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>

					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						<code class="literal">--debootstrap</code>, to cause the new system to be installed with <code class="command">debootstrap</code>; in that case, the <code class="literal">--dist</code> option will also most often be used (with a distribution name such as <span class="distribution distribution">squeeze</span>).
					</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>GOING FURTHER</em></span> Installing a non-Debian system in a domU</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
						If the Xen image is not meant to run Debian but another system, another potentially interesting option is <code class="literal">--rpmstrap</code>, to invoke <code class="command">rpmstrap</code> in order to initialize a new RPM-based system (such as Fedora, CentOS or Mandriva). Other methods include <code class="literal">--copy</code>, to copy an image from an existing system, and <code class="literal">--tar</code>, to extract the system image from an archive.
					</div><div class="para"><p></p>
						In case of a non-Linux system, care should be taken to define the kernel the domU must use, using the <code class="literal">--kernel</code> option.
					</div></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						<code class="literal">--dhcp</code> states that the domU's network configuration should be obtained by DHCP while <code class="literal">--ip</code> allows defining a static IP address.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Lastly, a storage method must be chosen for the images to be created (those that will be seen as hard disk drives from the domU). The simplest method, corresponding to the <code class="literal">--dir</code> option, is to create one file on the dom0 for each device the domU should be provided. For systems using LVM, the alternative is to use the <code class="literal">--lvm</code> option, followed by the name of a volume group; <code class="command">xen-create-image</code> will then create a new logical volume inside that group, and this logical volume will be made available to the domU as a hard disk drive.
					</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>NOTE</em></span> Storage in the domU</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
						Entire hard disks can also be exported to the domU, as well as partitions, RAID arrays or pre-existing LVM logical volumes. These operations are not automated by <code class="command">xen-create-image</code>, however, so editing the Xen image's configuration file is in order after its initial creation with <code class="command">xen-create-image</code>.

				We now have a virtual machine, but it is currently not running (and therefore only using space on the dom0's hard disk). Of course, we can create more images, possibly with different parameters.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Before turning these virtual machines on, we need to define how they'll be accessed. They can of course be considered as isolated machines, only accessed through their system console, but this rarely matches the usage pattern. Most of the time, a domU will be considered as a remote server, and accessed only through a network. However, it would be quite inconvenient to add a network card for each domU; which is why Xen allows creating virtual interfaces, that each domain can see and use in a standard way. Note that these cards, even though they're virtual, will only be useful once connected to a network, even a virtual one. Xen has several network models for that:
			</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						The simplest model is the <span class="emphasis"><em>bridge</em></span> model; all the eth0 network cards (both in the dom0 and the domU systems) behave as if they were directly plugged into an Ethernet switch.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Then comes the <span class="emphasis"><em>routing</em></span> mode, where the dom0 behaves as a router that stands between the domU systems and the (physical) external network.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
						Finally, in the <span class="emphasis"><em>NAT</em></span> mode, the dom0 is again between the domU systems and the rest of the network, but the domU systems are not directly accessible from outside, and traffic goes through some network address translation on the dom0.
					</div></li></ul></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				These three networking nodes involve a number of interfaces with unusual names, such as <code class="filename">vif*</code>, <code class="filename">veth*</code>, <code class="filename">peth*</code> and <code class="filename">xenbr0</code>. The Xen hypervisor arranges them in whichever layout has been defined, under the control of the user-space tools. Since the NAT and routing modes are only adapted to particular cases, we will only address the bridging model.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				The standard configuration of the Xen packages does not change the system-wide network configuration. However, the <code class="command">xend</code> daemon is configured to integrate virtual network interfaces into any pre-existing network bridge (with <code class="filename">xenbr0</code> taking precedence if several such bridges exist). We must therefore set up a bridge in <code class="filename">/etc/network/interfaces</code> (which requires installing the <span class="pkg pkg">bridge-utils</span> package, which is why the <span class="pkg pkg">xen-utils-4.0</span> recommends it) to replace the existing eth0 entry:
			</div><pre class="programlisting">auto xenbr0
iface xenbr0 inet dhcp
    bridge_ports eth0
    bridge_maxwait 0
</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
				After rebooting to make sure the bridge is automatically created, we can now start the domU with the Xen control tools, in particular the <code class="command">xm</code> command. This command allows different manipulations on the domains, including listing them and, starting/stopping them.

				While it is of course possible to have several domU systems running in parallel, they will all need to use their own image, since each domU is made to believe it runs on its own hardware (apart from the small slice of the kernel that talks to the hypervisor). In particular, it isn't possible for two domU systems running simultaneously to share storage space. If the domU systems are not run at the same time, it is however quite possible to reuse a single swap partition, or the partition hosting the <code class="filename">/home</code> filesystem.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Note that the <code class="filename">testxen</code> domU uses real memory taken from the RAM that would otherwise be available to the dom0, not simulated memory. Care should therefore be taken, when building a server meant to host Xen instances, to provision the physical RAM accordingly.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Voilà! Our virtual machine is starting up. We can access it in one of two modes. The usual way is to connect to it “remotely” through the network, as we would connect to a real machine; this will usually require setting up either a DHCP server or some DNS configuration. The other way, which may be the only way if the network configuration was incorrect, is to use the <code class="filename">hvc0</code> console, with the <code class="command">xm console</code> command:
			</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>xm console testxen</code></strong>

				One can then open a session, just like one would do if sitting at the virtual machine's keyboard. Detaching from this console is achieved through the <span class="keycap"><strong>Control</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>]</strong></span> key combination.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>TIP</em></span> Getting the console straight away</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Sometimes one wishes to start a domU system and get to its console straight away; this is why the <code class="command">xm create</code> command takes a <code class="literal">-c</code> switch. Starting a domU with this switch will display all the messages as the system boots.
			</div></div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>TOOL</em></span> ConVirt</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				ConVirt (in the <span class="pkg pkg">convirt</span> package, previously XenMan) is a graphical interface allowing controlling Xen domains installed on a machine. It provides most of the features of the <code class="command">xm</code> command.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Once the domU is up, it can be used just like any other server (since it is a GNU/Linux system after all). However, its virtual machine status allows some extra features. For instance, a domU can be temporarily paused then resumed, with the <code class="command">xm pause</code> and <code class="command">xm unpause</code> commands. Note that even though a paused domU does not use any processor power, its allocated memory is still in use. It may be interesting to consider the <code class="command">xm save</code> and <code class="command">xm restore</code> commands: saving a domU frees the resources that were previously used by this domU, including RAM. When restored (or unpaused, for that matter), a domU doesn't even notice anything beyond the passage of time. If a domU was running when the dom0 is shut down, the packaged scripts automatically save the domU, and restore it on the next boot. This will of course involve the standard inconvenience incurred when hibernating a laptop computer, for instance; in particular, if the domU is suspended for too long, network connections may expire. Note also that Xen is so far incompatible with a large part of ACPI power management, which precludes suspending the host (dom0) system.
			</div><div class="sidebar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>DOCUMENTATION</em></span> <code class="command">xm</code> options</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Most of the <code class="command">xm</code> subcommands expect one or more arguments, often a domU name. These arguments are well described in the <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">xm</span>(1)</span> manual page.
			</div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Halting or rebooting a domU can be done either from within the domU (with the <code class="command">shutdown</code> command) or from the dom0, with <code class="command">xm shutdown</code> or <code class="command">xm reboot</code>.
			</div><div class="sidebar fil"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h6><span class="emphasis"><em>GOING FURTHER</em></span> Advanced Xen</h6></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Xen has many more features than we can describe in these few paragraphs. In particular, the system is very dynamic, and many parameters for one domain (such as the amount of allocated memory, the visible hard drives, the behaviour of the task scheduler, and so on) can be adjusted even when that domain is running. A domU can even be migrated across servers without being shut down, and without losing its network connections! For all these advanced aspects, the primary source of information is the official Xen documentation. <div xmlns="" class="url">→ <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.xen.org/support/documentation.html">http://www.xen.org/support/documentation.html</a></div>
			</div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="lxc">12.2.2. LXC</h3></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Even though it's used to build “virtual machines”, LXC 
				<a id="idp10928448" class="indexterm"></a>
				 is not, strictly speaking, a virtualization system, but a system to isolate groups of processes from each other even though they all run on the same host. It takes advantages of a set of recent evolutions in the Linux kernel, collectively known as <span class="emphasis"><em>control groups</em></span>, by which different sets of processes called “groups” have different views of certain aspects of the overall system. Most notable among these aspects are the process identifiers, the network configuration, and the mount points. Such a group of isolated processes will not have any access to the other processes in the system, and its accesses to the filesystem can be restricted to a specific subset. It can also have its own network interface and routing table, and it may be configured to only see a subset of the available devices present on the system.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				These features can be combined to isolate a whole process family starting from the <code class="command">init</code> process, and the resulting set looks very much like a virtual machine. The official name for such a setup is a “container” (hence the LXC moniker: <span class="emphasis"><em>LinuX Containers</em></span>), but a rather important difference with “real” virtual machines such as provided by Xen or KVM is that there's no second kernel; the container uses the very same kernel as the host system. This has both pros and cons: advantages include the total lack of overhead and therefore performance costs, and the fact that the kernel has a global vision of all the processes running on the system, so the scheduling can be more efficient than it would be if two independent kernels were to schedule different task sets. Chief among the inconveniences is the impossibility to run a different kernel in a container (whether a different Linux version or a different operating system altogether).

				LXC containers do not provide the level of isolation achieved by heavier emulators or virtualizers. In particular:

						the <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> standard kernel does not allow limiting the amount of memory available to a container; this feature exists, and can be enabled by rebuilding the kernel with the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">Memory Resource Controller</em></span> option, but it is still considered somewhat experimental, and it has a (slight) cost on overall system performance, which is why it's disabled by default;
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>

				Since we're dealing with isolation and not plain virtualization, setting up LXC containers is more complex than just running debian-installer on a virtual machine. We'll describe a few prerequisites, then go on to the network configuration; we will then be able to actually create the system to be run in the container.
			</div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="idp11246464">12.2.2.1. Preliminary Steps</h4></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The <span class="pkg pkg">lxc</span> package contains the tools required to run LXC, and must therefore be installed.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					LXC also requires the <span class="emphasis"><em>control groups</em></span> configuration system, which is a virtual filesystem to be mounted on <code class="filename">/sys/fs/cgroup</code>. The <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> should therefore include the following entry:
				</div><pre class="programlisting scale"># /etc/fstab: static file system information.
[...]
cgroup            /sys/fs/cgroup           cgroup    defaults        0       0
</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					<code class="filename">/sys/fs/cgroup</code> will then be mounted automatically at boot time; if no immediate reboot is planned, the filesystem should be manually mounted with <code class="command">mount /sys/fs/cgroup</code>.
				</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="section.lxc.network">12.2.2.2. Network Configuration</h4></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The goal of installing LXC is to set up virtual machines; while we could of course keep them isolated from the network, and only communicate with them via the filesystem, most use cases involve giving at least minimal network access to the containers. In the typical case, each container will get a virtual network interface, connected to the real network through a bridge. This virtual interface can be plugged either directly onto the host's physical network interface (in which case the container is directly on the network), or onto another virtual interface defined on the host (and the host can then filter or route traffic). In both cases, the <span class="pkg pkg">bridge-utils</span> package will be required.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The simple case is just a matter of editing <code class="filename">/etc/network/interfaces</code>, moving the configuration for the physical interface (for instance <code class="literal">eth0</code>) to a bridge interface (usually <code class="literal">br0</code>), and configuring the link between them. For instance, if the network interface configuration file initially contains entries such as the following:
				</div><pre class="programlisting">auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					They should be disabled and replaced with the following:
				</div><pre class="programlisting">#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
  bridge-ports eth0</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					The effect of this configuration will be similar to what would be obtained if the containers were machines plugged into the same physical network as the host. The “bridge” configuration makes the Ethernet frames on all the bridged interfaces, which includes the physical <code class="literal">eth0</code> as well as the interfaces defined for the containers.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					In cases where this configuration cannot be used (for instance if no public IP addresses can be assigned to the containers), a virtual <span class="emphasis"><em>tap</em></span> interface will be created and connected to the bridge. The equivalent network topology then becomes that of a host with a second network card plugged into a separate switch, with the containers also plugged into that switch. The host must then act as a gateway for the containers if they are meant to communicate with the outside world.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					In addition to <span class="pkg pkg">bridge-utils</span>, this “rich” configuration requires the <span class="pkg pkg">vde2</span> package; the <code class="filename">/etc/network/interfaces</code> file then becomes:
				</div><pre class="programlisting"># Interface eth0 is unchanged
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

# Virtual interface 
auto tap0
iface tap0 inet manual
  vde2-switch -t tap0

# Bridge for containers
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
  bridge-ports tap0
  address 10.0.0.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					The network can then be either be set up statically in the containers, or dynamically with DHCP server running on the host. Such a DHCP server will need to be configured to answer queries on the <code class="literal">br0</code> interface.
				</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="idp11258056">12.2.2.3. Setting Up the System</h4></div></div></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Let us now set up the filesystem to be used by the container. Since this “virtual machine” will not run directly on the hardware, some tweaks are required when compared to a standard filesystem, especially as far as the kernel, devices and consoles are concerned. Fortunately, the <span class="pkg pkg">lxc</span> includes scripts that mostly automate this configuration. For instance, the following commands (which require the <span class="pkg pkg">debootstrap</span> package) will install a Debian container:
				</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">root@scouzmir:~# </code><strong class="userinput"><code>mkdir /var/lib/lxc/testlxc/

root@scouzmir:~# </code>
</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					Note that the filesystem is initially created in <code class="filename">/var/cache/lxc</code>, then moved to its destination directory. This allows creating identical containers much more quickly, since only copying is then required.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Note also that the <code class="command">lxc-debian</code> command as shipped in <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> unfortunately creates a <span class="distribution distribution">Lenny</span> system, and not a <span class="distribution distribution">Squeeze</span> system as one could expect. This problem can be worked around by simply installing a newer version of the package (starting from 0.7.3-1).
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					The newly-created filesystem now contains a minimal Debian system, adapted to the aforementioned “simple” network configuration. In the “rich” configuration, the <code class="filename">/var/lib/lxc/testlxc/rootfs/etc/network/interfaces</code> file will need some modifications; more important, though, is that the network interface that the container sees must not be the host's physical interface. This can be configured by adding a few <code class="literal">lxc.network.*</code> entries to the container's configuration file, <code class="filename">/var/lib/lxc/testlxc/config</code>:
				</div><pre class="programlisting">lxc.network.type = veth
lxc.network.flags = up
lxc.network.link = br0
lxc.network.hwaddr = 4a:49:43:49:79:20
</pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					These entries mean, respectively, that a virtual interface will be created in the container; that it will automatically be brought up when said container is started; that it will automatically be connected to the <code class="literal">br0</code> bridge on the host; and that its MAC address will be as specified. Should this last entry be missing or disabled, a random MAC address will be generated.

					We are now in the container; our access to the processes is restricted to only those started from the container itself, and our access to the filesystem is similarly restricted to the dedicated subset of the full filesystem (<code class="filename">/var/lib/lxc/testlxc/rootfs</code>), in which root's password is initially set to <code class="literal">root</code>.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					Should we want to run the container as a background process, we would invoke <code class="command">lxc-start</code> with the <code class="option">--daemon</code> option. We can then interrupt the container with a command such as <code class="command">lxc-kill --name=testlxc</code>.

					The <span class="pkg pkg">lxc</span> package contains an initialization script that can automatically start one or several containers when the host boots; its configuration file, <code class="filename">/etc/default/lxc</code>, is relatively straightforward; note that the container configuration files need to be stored in <code class="filename">/etc/lxc/</code>; many users may prefer symbolic links, such as can be created with <code class="command">ln -s /var/lib/lxc/testlxc/config /etc/lxc/testlxc.config</code>.

					Since LXC is a very lightweight isolation system, it can be particularly adapted to massive hosting of virtual servers. The network configuration will probably be a bit more advanced than what we described above, but the “rich” configuration using <code class="literal">tap</code> and <code class="literal">veth</code> interfaces should be enough in many cases.
				</div><div class="para"><p></p>
					It may also make sense to share part of the filesystem, such as the <code class="filename">/usr</code> and <code class="filename">/lib</code> subtrees, so as to avoid duplicating the software that may need to be common to several containers. This will usually be achieved with <code class="literal">lxc.mount.entry</code> entries in the containers configuration file. An interesting side-effect is that the processes will then use less physical memory, since the kernel is able to detect that the programs are shared. The marginal cost of one extra container can then be reduced to the disk space dedicated to its specific data, and a few extra processes that the kernel must schedule and manage.

				KVM, which stands for <span class="emphasis"><em>Kernel-based Virtual Machine</em></span>, is first and foremost a kernel module providing most of the infrastructure that can be used by a virtualizer, but it is not a virtualizer by itself. Actual control for the virtualization is handled by a QEMU-based application. Don't worry if this section mentions <code class="command">qemu-*</code> commands: it's still about KVM.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				Unlike other virtualization systems, KVM was merged into the Linux kernel right from the start. Its developers chose to take advantage of the processor instruction sets dedicated to virtualization (Intel-VT and AMD-V), which keeps KVM lightweight, elegant and not resource-hungry. The counterpart, of course, is that KVM only works on i386 and amd64 processors, and only those recent enough to have these instruction sets.
			</div><div class="para"><p></p>
				With Red Hat actively supporting its development, KVM looks poised to become the reference for Linux virtualization.

					Unlike such tools as VirtualBox, KVM itself doesn't include any user-interface for creating and managing virtual machines. The <span class="pkg pkg">qemu-kvm</span> package only provides an executable able to start a virtual machine, as well as an initialization script that loads the appropriate kernel modules.
				</div><a id="idp11284040" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp11284520" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					Fortunately, Red Hat also provides another set of tools to address that problem, by developing the <span class="emphasis"><em>libvirt</em></span> library and the associated <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual-manager</em></span> tools. libvirt allows managing virtual machines in a uniform way, independently of the virtualization system involved behind the scenes (it currently supports QEMU, KVM, Xen, LXC, OpenVZ, VirtualBox, VMWare and UML). <code class="command">virtual-manager</code> is a graphical interface that uses libvirt to create and manage virtual machines.

In addition, this package provides the <code class="command">virsh</code> command-line tool, which allows controlling the <code class="command">libvirtd</code>-managed machines.

							The <code class="literal">--cdrom</code> option is used to indicate where to find the optical disk to use for installation. The path can be either a local path for an ISO file, an URL where the file can be obtained, or the device file of a physical CD-ROM drive (i.e. <code class="literal">/dev/cdrom</code>).
						</div></td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top" align="left"><p><a href="#virtinst.network"><img class="callout" src="Common_Content/images/7.png" alt="7" border="0" id="virtinst.network" /></a> </p></td><td valign="top" align="left"><div class="para"><p></p>
							The <code class="literal">--network</code> specifies how the virtual network card integrates in the host's network configuration. The default behaviour (which we explicitly forced in our example) is to integrate it into any pre-existing network bridge. If no such bridge exists, the virtual machine will only reach the physical network through NAT, so it gets an address in a private subnet range (192.168.122.0/24).

							<code class="literal">--vnc</code> states that the graphical console should be made available using VNC. The default behaviour for the associated VNC server is no only listen on the local interface; if the VNC client is to be run on a different host, establishing the connection will require setting up an SSH tunnel (see <a class="xref" href="sect.remote-login.html#section.ssh-port-forwarding">Section 9.2.2.3, “Creating Encrypted Tunnels with Port Forwarding”</a>). Alternatively, the <code class="literal">--vnclisten=0.0.0.0</code> can be used so that the VNC server is accessible from all interfaces; note that if you do that, you really should design your firewall accordingly.

							The <code class="literal">--os-type</code> and <code class="literal">--os-variant</code> options allow optimizing a few parameters of the virtual machine, based on some of the known features of the operating system mentioned there.

					At this point, the virtual machine is running, and we need to connect to the graphical console to proceed with the installation process. If the previous operation was run from a graphical desktop environment, this connection should be automatically started. If not, or if we operate remotely, <code class="command">virt-viewer</code> can be used to run it:
				</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput">$ </code><strong class="userinput"><code>virt-viewer --connect qemu+ssh://root@server/system
</code></strong><code class="computeroutput">root@server's password: 
root@server's password: </code></pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					When the installation process ends, the virtual machine is restarted, now ready for use.
				</div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="idp11316224">12.2.3.4. Managing Machines with <code class="command">virsh</code></h4></div></div></div><a id="idp11316768" class="indexterm"></a><div class="para"><p></p>
					Now that the installation is done, let us see how to handle the available virtual machines. The first thing to try is to ask <code class="command">libvirtd</code> for the list of the virtual machines it manages:
				</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>virsh -c qemu:///system list --all
 Id Name                 State
----------------------------------
  - testkvm              shut off
</code></strong></pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					Let's start our test virtual machine:
				</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>virsh -c qemu:///system start testkvm
</code></strong><code class="computeroutput">Domain testkvm started</code></pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					We can now get the connection instructions for the graphical console:
				</div><pre class="screen"><code class="computeroutput"># </code><strong class="userinput"><code>virsh -c qemu:///system vncdisplay testkvm
</code></strong><code class="computeroutput">:0</code></pre><div class="para"><p></p>
					Other available <code class="command">virsh</code> subcommands include:
				</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">reboot</code> to restart a virtual machine;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">shutdown</code> to trigger a clean shutdown;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">destroy</code>, to stop it brutally;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">suspend</code> to pause it;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">resume</code> to unpause it;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">autostart</code> to enable (or disable, with the <code class="literal">--disable</code> option) starting the virtual machine automatically when the host starts;
						</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para"><p></p>
							<code class="literal">undefine</code> to remove all traces of the virtual machine from <code class="command">libvirtd</code>.
						</div></li></ul></div><div class="para"><p></p>
					All these subcommands take a virtual machine identifier as a parameter.
